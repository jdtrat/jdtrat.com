  Hi! I'm Jonathan. I'm a data scientist who dabbles in web development, Bayesian Statistics, Reinforcement Learning, and #dataviz. Some (not so) fun facts about me:
  * I'm from Orlando, FL, and I get asked if I go to Disney a lot more times than I’ve been to Disney.
  * I like going to the gym to pick things up and put them down again.
  * I enjoy reading and sleeping, though not at the same time.
  * I’m a sushi lover (and chef) who is slightly concerned about consuming too much mercury.
  * I have the cutest cat ever, Tucker "Tux" Trattner.
