# Motivation

The original idea for {shinysurveys} was to provide a select set of
well-supported input types that are commonly used with surveys. However,
shortly after the package was published on CRAN, additional input types
were requested (see GitHub [issue
\#6](https://github.com/jdtrat/shinysurveys/issues/6) or
[\#18](https://github.com/jdtrat/shinysurveys/issues/18)).

In order to make the package as light-weight as possible (minimize
dependence on external code), I did not wish to implement any input
types not native to {shiny}. I also did not want to rewrite the
internals of {shinysurveys} whenever a new input-type was requested. As
a solution, I developed a framework for custom inputs to allow users to
include different input types that meet their use case. In the next
section, I outline three examples of how to add custom input types.

As of now, custom inputs are only supported in the development version of {shinysurveys}, which can be installed as follows:

```{r install-dev-version, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jdtrat/shinysurveys@extend-shinysurveys")
library(shinysurveys)
```

# Examples

## Adding a `sliderInput`

Consider the question "On a scale from 1-10, how much do you love
sushi?". An ideal input type would be {shiny}'s `sliderInput`. However,
this is not natively supported by {shinysurveys} as the slider input
requires multiple arguments, including a minimum, maximum, and starting
value. To get around this, we can define a new input type using a new
function `extendInputType()`. As in a typical shiny survey, we can
define our question as follows:

```{r define-question}
# Define a question as normal with the `input_type` set to "slider", which is not natively supported by {shinysurveys}.

slider_question <- data.frame(
  question = "On a scale from 1-10, how much do you love sushi?",
  option = NA,
  input_type = "slider",
  input_id = "sushi_scale",
  dependence = NA,
  dependence_value = NA,
  required = TRUE
  )
```

This looks like:

```{r echo = FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(slider_question, format = 'html') %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

If we try to define the user-interface component of the shiny
application, we will get the following error which most commonly occurs
when {shinysurveys} doesn't recognize an input type.

```{r demo-slider-without-extension, error = TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(shinysurveys)

ui <- fluidPage(
  surveyOutput(df = slider_question,
               survey_title = "Testing the Slider Input")
)

```

To overcome this, we can use `extendInputType()`. This function accepts
two arguments. The first, `input_type`, is a string of the input type
used in the questions data frame. The second is the input definition.
Consider:

```{r extend-input-type-slider}

# Register a slider input to {shinysurveys} with a custom minimum and maximum value.

extendInputType(input_type = "slider", {
  shiny::sliderInput(
    inputId = surveyID(),
    label = surveyLabel(),
    min = 1,
    max = 10,
    value = 5
    ) 
})

```

Note the inputId and label are set to `surveyID()` and `surveyLabel()`,
respectively. These are necessary helper functions to ensure that survey
features such as required questions function properly. As such, **all
extensions need `inputId = surveyID()` and `label = surveyLabel()`.**

Now, when we try to define the user-interface, we don't see any errors:

```{r demo-slider-input}

# By defining the input type above, this works! Yay!
ui <- fluidPage(
  surveyOutput(df = slider_question,
               survey_title = "Testing the Slider Input")
)

```

When running the full application, we see the following survey:

## Adding a `dateInput`

As requested in issue
[\#18](https://github.com/jdtrat/shinysurveys/issues/18), a user needed
a `dateInput` with special restrictions for possible values (dates).
[The user's
reprex](https://github.com/jdtrat/shinysurveys/issues/18#issue-856073749)
showed the error we saw earlier, because {shinysurveys} does not
natively support "date" inputs. Consider again the following question:

```{r define-date-question}

# Define a question as normal with the `input_type` set to "date", which is not natively supported by {shinysurveys}.
date_question <- data.frame(
  question = "When do you graduate?",
  option = NA,
  input_type = "date",
  input_id = "grad_date",
  dependence = NA,
  dependence_value = NA,
  required = FALSE
  )
```

This looks like:

```{r echo = FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(date_question, format = 'html') %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

As in the slider example, if we try to define the user-interface
component of the shiny application, we will get the following error
which most commonly occurs when {shinysurveys} doesn't recognize an
input type.

```{r demo-date-without-extension, error = TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(shinysurveys)

ui <- fluidPage(
  surveyOutput(df = date_question,
               survey_title = "Testing the Date Input")
)

```

Using `extendInputType()` we can overcome this.

```{r extend-input-type-date}

# Register a date input to {shinysurveys}, limiting possible dates to a twenty-day period.

extendInputType("date", {
  shiny::dateInput(
    inputId = surveyID(),
    value = Sys.Date(),
    label = surveyLabel(),
    min = Sys.Date()-10,
    max = Sys.Date()+10
  )
})

```

Now, when we try to define the user-interface, we don't see any errors:

```{r demo-date-input}

# By defining the input type above, this works! Yay!
ui <- fluidPage(
  surveyOutput(df = date_question,
               survey_title = "Testing the Date Input")
)

```

When running the full application, we see the following survey:

## Adding a `sliderTextInput`

Both of the previous examples showed how to extend {shinysurveys} with
inputs native to the {shiny} package. What about other packages, though?
Could you use any input type? Turns out, you can! Consider a special
text-based slider input from the package
[{shinyWidgets}](https://dreamrs.github.io/shinyWidgets/index.html).
This allows you to have text labels on a slider input, unlike the one
built into {shiny}.

Consider the question "Please indicate how strongly you love sushi from
'Fish? Yuck!' to 'Love of my life'." We can define it as follows:

```{r define-textSlider-question}

# Define a question as normal with the `input_type` set to "date", which is not natively supported by {shinysurveys}.
textSlider_question <- data.frame(
  question = "Please indicate how strongly you love sushi from 'Fish? Yuck!' to 'Love of my life'.",
  option = NA,
  input_type = "textSlider",
  input_id = "sushi_feelings",
  dependence = NA,
  dependence_value = NA,
  required = FALSE
  )
```

This looks like:

```{r echo = FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(textSlider_question, format = 'html') %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

We define the "textSlider" extension below and see an error-free
user-interface definiton:

```{r extend-input-type-textSlider-and-demo-textSlider}
extendInputType("textSlider", {
  shinyWidgets::sliderTextInput(
    inputId = surveyID(),
    label = surveyLabel(),
    force_edges = TRUE,
    choices = c("Love of my life", "Big fan", "I can eat it", "It's not cooked?", "Fish? Yuck!"),
    selected = "I can eat it"
  )
})

# By defining the input type above, this works! Yay!
ui <- fluidPage(
  surveyOutput(df = textSlider_question,
               survey_title = "Testing the Text Slider Input")
)

```

When running the full application, we see the following survey:
