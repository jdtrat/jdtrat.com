Because Shiny has JQuery as a dependency, though, we can do this in an easier way!

I think JQuery is nicer to work with, so I'm going to use this second method.

# Functionalize our JavaScript

--

```{js, eval = FALSE}

function addClass(params) { 
$("#" + params.input_id).addClass(params.class_name);
}

```

--

* Define a function that takes in an object `params`
--

  * `params` will contain an input id and class name
--

* When called, this function will add the specified class to the specified element.

???

We're presumably going to want to add classes to multiple input types, so let's go ahead and convert our addClass statement to a function that takes in the id of the element and the class name.

# `r emo::ji("three")` Wrap as Message Handler 

```{js, eval = FALSE}
// when JavaScript receives the message "add_class" 
// perform this function
Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler("add_class", function (params) { 
$("#" + params.input_id).addClass(params.class_name);
});
```

???

So our step one was to figure out what we want to do
Step 2 was to do it in JavaScript
Step 3 is to wrap our JavaScript code so Shiny can talk to it.

A JavaScript event handler is a way to trigger certain actions whenever a specific event occurs -- just like Shiny's observeEvent. We can tell it what to look for. In this case, we're going to define a MESSAGE handler, which just means "any time you get a message X, do Y."

So in JavaScript, we have the object "Shiny" which has different methods that we can implement. In this case, we want to add a custom message handler. So what this says is that any time the JavaScript server receives a message "add_class", ewxecute the function addClass.

Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler is basically an event handler (think an observer in Shiny) or a sensor that only responds when activated. In this case, we are setting it to activate when it receives the message "add_class".

# `r emo::ji("four")` Call `addClass()` from R

# `r emo::ji("four")` Call `addClass()` from R

* We have our JavaScript message handler `r emo::ji("search")`
  * How do we trigger it?
  
```{.r}
session$sendCustomMessage()
```

???

Well, we have a message handler looking for messages on the JS side, so it makes sense that we would need to send one! We can use the `sendCustomMessage()` function to do so. But remember that our function took an argument params. Well, can easily create one with R as a list! Let's define a function:

---
class: top

.my-header[
.title[
Integrating JavaScript
]
]

# `r emo::ji("four")` Call `addClass()` from R

.instructions[
Recall our `params` object had two items: 
* `input_id`
* `class_name`
]

--

Well, let's define a function that accepts those two values:

```{r}
add_class <- function(.id, .class) {
  # What should go here?
}
```

???
Exactly! If you said that `sendCustomMessage` should go in that function, you're exactly right! Let's take a look at the full function.


---
class: top

.my-header[
.title[
Integrating JavaScript
]
]

# `r emo::ji("four")` Call `addClass()` from R

```{r}
add_class <- function(.id, .class) {
  session <- shiny::getDefaultReactiveDomain()
  session$sendCustomMessage(
    "add_class",
    list(input_id = .id,
         class_name = .class)
  )
}
```

???
Walking through this line by line. 

The first line shows the session being assigned as the default reactive domain. That's just a way to avoid passing in the Shiny object explicitly from the server.

The second line is where the magic happens, we are using the reactive session object and saying "let's send a custom message". 
This first argument is the message we want to send, and it should match the customMessageHandler that we defined on the JavaScript side. In our case, it's simply "add_class".

The second argument is what will become our params object -- it's simply a list that contains all of our arguments. In this case, the input_id and the class_name.
